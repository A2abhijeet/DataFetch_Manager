# Contributing to DataFetch_Manager!

Welcome to the DataFetch_Manager! We‚Äôre glad you‚Äôre here to contribute to a growing collection of essential code solutions. Whether you‚Äôre here for Hacktoberfest or to enhance this repository, we appreciate your efforts!


## Features

- **Global State Management**: Leverage Redux for managing application state, including UI controls and user authentication.
- **Server-Side Data Fetching**: Use React Query for efficient data fetching, caching, and synchronization with server-side data.
- **Optimized Performance**: Minimize API calls and improve app performance through effective caching strategies.
- **Error Handling**: Implement centralized error handling for both local (Redux) and server-side (React Query) data operations.
- **Real-Time Data Updates**: Automatically refetch and update data in the UI as server-side changes occur.
- **Offline Support**: React Query provides offline capabilities, queuing requests until the network is available.
- **Pagination and Infinite Scrolling**: Handle large datasets efficiently with pagination and infinite scrolling techniques.

## Concepts

- **React Query**: A powerful library for data fetching in React applications, allowing you to cache, synchronize, and manage server state easily.
- **Redux**: A predictable state container for JavaScript apps that helps manage the global state of the application.
- **Cache Management**: Use React Query's caching features to optimize API call frequency and improve user experience.
- **Query Keys**: Unique identifiers for queries in React Query; changes in the query key trigger refetching.
- **Mutations**: React Query's mechanism for modifying server-side data, with automatic cache updates based on the result.
- **Stale Time**: Configurable duration for which cached data is considered fresh before a refetch is required.
- **Invalidation**: The process of marking a query as stale so it can be refetched when needed.

## Common Issues and Resolutions

1. **Redux State Not Updating**  
   *Resolution*: Ensure your reducers are pure functions that return new state objects instead of mutating the existing state.

2. **React Query Not Refetching Data**  
   *Resolution*: After a mutation, call `queryClient.invalidateQueries('queryKey')` to refetch the data.

3. **API Data Not Caching**  
   *Resolution*: Verify that you are using the correct `staleTime` and `cacheTime` options in your queries.

4. **Error Handling Not User-Friendly**  
   *Resolution*: Implement user-friendly error messages in the UI based on error states from both Redux and React Query.

5. **UI Not Re-rendering**  
   *Resolution*: Ensure that the query keys in your `useQuery` calls change when relevant data changes, prompting React Query to refetch data.

6. **React Query Data Stale After Manual Refetch**  
   *Resolution*: Check if you are invalidating the correct query with the appropriate query key.

7. **Create Node Server Using TypeScript**  
   *Resolution*: Initialize a new Node.js project with TypeScript, and ensure your `server.ts` file is set up correctly.

8. **Develop a Landing Page Using React.js**  
   *Resolution*: Create a new component for the landing page, ensuring it's integrated into your application's routing.

9. **Implement Axios to Get Data from APIs to React Components**  
   *Resolution*: Use Axios to create an API service for fetching data and handle responses and errors effectively.

10. **Handling CORS Issues**  
   *Resolution*: Ensure your Node server has CORS enabled by using the `cors` middleware.

11. **Data Not Displaying in UI**  
   *Resolution*: Check if the data fetched from the API is being correctly passed to the component's state.

12. **Performance Issues with Large Datasets**  
   *Resolution*: Implement pagination or infinite scrolling to handle large datasets efficiently.

13. **React Query Queries Not Triggering**  
   *Resolution*: Ensure that the conditions for triggering the queries are correctly defined in your `useQuery` calls.

14. **State Not Syncing Between Client and Server**  
   *Resolution*: Use `useQuery` and `mutations` together to ensure that state changes on the server are reflected in the client state.

    3.  Create a new branch: It‚Äôs recommended to work in a new branch for each contribution.

        git checkout -b feature-branch

    4.  Make your changes: Add new algorithms or enhance the existing ones. Be sure to write clean and well-documented code.

	5.	Commit your changes: Write meaningful commit messages that describe your changes clearly.

        git commit -m "Added [algorithm name] or Improved [functionality]"

    6.  Push your branch: Push your branch to your forked GitHub repository.
    
        git push origin feature-branch

    7.	Create a Pull Request: Navigate to this repository on GitHub, click ‚ÄúNew Pull Request,‚Äù and follow the prompts.

    What We Expect:

	‚Ä¢	Clarity: Make sure your code is well-documented with comments and follows consistent formatting.
	‚Ä¢	Efficiency: Algorithms should be optimized for performance, with explanations if needed.
	‚Ä¢	Readability: Ensure your code is easy to understand for other contributors or learners.
	‚Ä¢	Tested Code: Please test your contributions before submitting a Pull Request (PR).

Contribution Guidelines

	‚Ä¢	Ensure that your code or improvements are not already present in the repository. Check existing contributions before adding your own.
	‚Ä¢	Each algorithm should have a brief description of its purpose, time complexity, and use cases in the code comments or as a markdown file (if necessary).
	‚Ä¢	No plagiarized content. Always provide credit if you use or adapt existing solutions.
	‚Ä¢	Contributions should focus on common algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching, dynamic programming) or well-known problems (e.g., Fibonacci series, factorial) that can help others prepare for interviews or coding challenges.
